== Hpricot, Read Any HTML

Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C.  It's designed to be very
accomodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to have a very helpful library (like
some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, Prototype -- give you.)

Also, Hpricot can be handy for reading broken XML files, since many of the same
principles are used.  If a quote is missing, Hpricot tries to figure it out.  If
tags overlap, Hpricot works on sorting them out.  You know, that sort of thing.

== The Hpricot Kingdom

First, here are all the links you need to know:

* http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ is the Hpricot wiki and bug tracker.
  Go there for news and recipes and patches.  It's the center of activity.
* http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/svn/hpricot/trunk/ is the main Subversion
  repository for Hpricot.
* See COPYING for the terms of this software. (Spoiler: it's absolutely free.)

Still need a link for Hpricot docs.  Well, remind me to come back to it.
